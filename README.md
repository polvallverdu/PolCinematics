# PolCinematics
A mod that allows cinematics to be played in the game. It has a beautiful and performant intuitive camera system, with timelines to allow multiple overlays (such as videos or images) to be shown. It also has a built-in audio system, allowing you to play music and sound effects.

### Where's the license?
I have 2 reasons why this project doesn't have a license at the moment:
1. It's still WIP. (not ready yet)
2. I'm lazy :D

### Things I would love to add
- [] Play sounds with location.
- [] Video effects (shake, displacement, etc.)
- [] UI with a timeline to control keypoints and easings.
